        <p>As one of the curators on <a href="https://react.statuscode.com">React Status</a> (a weekly email rounding up the latest React news, tutorials, and tools), at the end of each year I like to reflect back on the most popular links from the past twelve months.</p>

        <p>So, without further ado, here's a look at ten of the most clicked React links in 2020.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-libraries">The Key React Libraries to Use in 2020</a></strong></p>

        <p>Everyone loves a curated list! This one came right at the start of 2020 and intelligently bought together a variety of key React libraries that still remain valuable. Here's hoping Robin or someone else does a similar list for 2021.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/">Five Common Mistakes Writing Components (with Hooks)</a></strong></p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://t.co/aiwlqtPMga?amp=1">The Ugly Side of React Hooks</a></strong></p>

        <p>We've covered hooks almost non-stop in React Status since their appearance two years ago, and mostly in a positive light. So we were intrigued to find an article trying to form another side of the argument. From the comments, though, clearly not everybody agreed with the author’s assertions. Dillon Shook's <em><a href="https://dillonshook.com/a-critique-of-react-hooks/">A Critique of React Hooks</a></em> covered similar ground.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch">Stop Mocking <code>fetch</code></a></strong></p>

        <p>Another developer who had a very strong year of blogging about React was Kent C Dodds! Here he covered not only why you shouldn’t mock <code>fetch</code> or your API clients in your tests but what to consider <em>instead</em>.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://maxrozen.com/guide-to-component-ui-libraries-react/">A Guide to Six Commonly Used React Component Libraries </a></strong></p>

        <p>There are literally <em>hundreds</em> of repos on GitHub all of which are intended to contribute something to the React ecosystem. The flipside of that excellent state of affairs, for the beginner, is precisely where to start your own React journey. The author offers an informed, experienced opinion of the landscape in the component library space.</p>

        <p>In this ten-minute video Lee makes the bold claim that he thinks “<em>the future of React is actually Next.js</em>”, but attempts to break it down and explains where he sees React’s role growing server-side.</p>
