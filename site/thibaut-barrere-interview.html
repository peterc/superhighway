        <p>Thibaut Barr√®re is a long-time Rubyist and data engineer who built and maintains the popular Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) framework <a href="https://github.com/thbar/kiba">Kiba</a>. </p>

        <p>We asked him some questions about his work:</p>

        <p><strong>What inspired you to create Kiba?</strong></p>

        <p>A lot of my work since ~2005 has been focused on data integration (making systems speak together), data aggregation etc. I sometimes used GUI-based tools like Microsoft SSIS which, while powerful, are quite far from the coding experience.</p>

        <p>I was already using Ruby at that time, and was happy to discover <a href="https://github.com/activewarehouse/activewarehouse-etl">activewarehouse-etl</a> (<em>maintained by Anthony Eden, who runs DNSimple now</em>) providing a Ruby DSL to declare data pipelines. I used it for a while with very good success to implement data extractions and business intelligence ETL, and ultimately took over the maintenance.</p>

        <p>In the long run, though (as I explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv1EnYTXIeA">a recent Paris.rb talk</a>), the balance between the the cost of OSS maintenance and the usability for my billable and non-billable use-cases proved to be not good enough, which made me decide to stop the maintenance, sadly.</p>

        <p>I still wanted to use Ruby to write data pipelines, but I needed to cover more use-cases and reduce the OSS maintenance burden at the same time. This ultimately led me to write and share (in 2015) <a href="https://github.com/thbar/kiba">Kiba ETL</a>, a focused DSL for declarative processing, matching those criterias.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you find yourself adding more features while in quarantine?</strong></p>

        <p>Before the quarantine, I directed my Kiba bandwith and focus on finalizing Kiba v3 and rewriting the documentation from scratch, to properly encourage best practices I‚Äôve been discovering. I also created experimental branches for Ruby 2.7/2.8 keywords.</p>

        <p>During the quarantine, I've reduced client work and OSS work too, to focus on shipping Kiba Pro v2 (which I‚Äôll announce shortly officially). I‚Äôve extracted and generalized (from real-life projects) very useful components, such as a ‚Äúbatch SQL lookup‚Äù (useful when replacing relationships keys during data migrations and datawarehouses sync code, in batch rather than row by row), a ‚Äúfile lock‚Äù to ensure a single job runs at once, and a ‚Äúparallel transform‚Äù to achieve easy concurrency for things like HTTP queries.</p>

        <p><strong>What's the wildest ETL that you've encountered?</strong></p>

        <p>Getting the data out of a system which is actively not acting in that direction is always a bit wild.. One can see all types of fancy stuff on the field. For instance, it is not uncommon to have an ETL process start a headless browser, jump through pages, just to get to the CSV/PDF/Excel file that you will then use as your data source!</p>

        <p>You can also end up having to figure out ways to read or write very old file formats at times. Recently I wrote a Kiba component to generate a COBOL delimited file, for instance. In large companies, a very widely used I/O is good old SFTP, far away from modern APIs and formats.</p>

        <p><strong>Can you tell us how to say your last name? üòâ</strong></p>

        <p>I had to deploy a page to my blog to answer that question properly üôÇ. You‚Äôll <a href="https://thibautbarrere.com/how-to-pronounce/" title="How to pronounce Thibaut Barrere">find out how to say my name here</a>.</p>

        <p style="border-left: 4px solid #E2E8F0; padding-left: 20px; color: #666;"><em>Merci Thibaut!</em> You can read some of Thibaut's posts on his <a href="https://thibautbarrere.com">blog</a> and find out more about <a href="https://www.kiba-etl.org">Kiba ETL here</a>.</p>
