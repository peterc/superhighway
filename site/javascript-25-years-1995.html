        <h1>Here’s what people in tech had to say about JavaScript when it debuted in 1995</h1>
        <h2>Quotes from 25 years ago.</h2>

        <img src="https://superhighway.dev/images/v1607013680/w3faz3fpcfaiej5mnun2.gif"  style="float:right; height: 120px; margin: 20px 0px 20px 40px;">

        <p>Time and time again JavaScript is crowned the <strong>most popular programming language in the World</strong>. Whether you agree with that or not, one thing’s for sure: <em>It’s come a long way since its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#History">debut back in 1995</a></em>.</p>

        <p>Whilst Brendan Eich was hard at work creating the now much loved language twenty-five years ago, the O.J Simpson trial was well underway, Ross and Rachel weren’t quite on a break, <em>yet</em> — and Pixar's Toy Story was mere weeks away from hitting theatres.</p>

        <p>Oh, and Wikipedia informs me that 1995 also marks the year in which ISP’s like AOL and Prodigy offered up mainstream access to the World Wide Web for the first time (<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/aol-cd-rom-collecting-thing-180956902/">remember those CDs</a>), releasing browsers that made ‘<em>surfing the web</em>’ easily accessible to the general public.</p>

        <p><strong>Sounds like it was the perfect time to be creating a programming language for browsers</strong>.</p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The birth of JavaScript in 4 slides: <a href="https://t.co/i24LhfkgCY">pic.twitter.com/i24LhfkgCY</a></p>&mdash; JavaScript Daily (@JavaScriptDaily) <a href="https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily/status/809071560107655168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

        <p>To mark the release of JavaScript <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html">a joint press release was issued</a> from Netscape and Sun Microsystems on December 4, 1995.</p>

        <p>This release claimed that JavaScript would be an “easy-to-use” scripting language designed for “creating live online applications”.</p>

        <p>The press release then went on to share praise from then industry bigwigs.</p>

        <p><strong>Here’s what members of the tech industry (of '28 industry-leading companies') had to say about little old JavaScript back in 1995</strong>. Some of the companies here are still going, others… not so much.</p>

        <p>Note: <em>Job titles are from the press release of the time</em></p>

        <p>All of the above comments from the early days of JavaScript are now 25 years old. How well do you think they’ve aged? 😅</p>
