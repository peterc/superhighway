        <p>Nick is a developer, presenter, and lover of pubs who has created numerous tools and frameworks to scratch his itches with Rails.</p>

        <p><strong>You have written a few gems that, in short, go around The Rails Way (trailblazer, cells, reform). How come?</strong></p>

        <p>Not because I wanted to oppose anything, but I was more interested in enriching Rails with additional layers as I felt it's lacking a lot of necessary abstractions. The Rails Way oversimplifies things and you keep a lot of responsibilities in one big class. I didn't feel that's proper OOP, so I introduced small, clean, encapsulated objects for view components, forms, parsing and rendering, control flow, and now we got Trailblazer as an umbrella project providing more layers for Ruby frameworks.</p>

        <p><strong>What do you like about Rails?</strong></p>

        <p>Definitely the community! The way this framework unites so many people of so many shades is crazy. When you're discussing how proper encapsulation looks, over the 6th beer in a pub in, say, Lviv (Ukraine), along with a dozen people you met a few hours ago, then you know this community kicks ass. To be fair, I'm happy Rails exists, I'm not a fan of how some parts are done, but over the past couple of years, it's been a great experience providing extensions that do not necessarily interfere with the framework itself. If you had asked me the same question 10 years ago, the answer would've been a different one. ;)</p>

        <p><strong>What is your go to web stack these days?</strong></p>

        <p>Rails, believe it or not! With the newer versions, it's been simple to strip off unnecessary extensions, and a lot of its tools and tool conventions (not the coding conventions!) are battle-tested and intuitive. For the near future, we're planning on exploring <a href="https://hanamirb.org">Hanami</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system">dry-system</a> for loading dependencies, but so far all our internal tools are Rails based, sugared with a Trailblazer architecture.</p>

        <p><strong>You're a prolific presenter. Name a couple of your favorite presentations youâ€™ve given or venues youâ€™ve attended.</strong></p>

        <p>I need to talk to my lawyer - this is a question I cannot answer easily. Every single conf I've been to has been magnificent. Generally speaking, I more and more enjoy giving talks with around 40 slides and a few code snippets to explain. It's more fun to banter and I always hated walking the audience through too much code. With this in mind, a talk I really enjoyed recently was '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjsnd8dJbew">If - The Vodka of Ruby</a>' at RubyRussia. One of the conferences that comes to my mind is Rocky Mountain Ruby Conf, the venue was a cinema, and our lanyards were accepted as payment currency in most bars in Boulder - good times!</p>

        <p><strong>What is your go to pint?</strong></p>

        <p>As much as I love bitter German pilsner, I would die for a Little Creature pale ale from Freemantle, Australia right now. It tastes like a pretty strong IPA, deliciously flavored with beautiful fruity hops, making my mouth water as I type. Prost!</p>
